										<h2><a href="#">Credit Manager Platform</a></h2>
                                        <p>Credit Manager is a platform where customers of CTOS can check credit scores of other businesses and individuals. There are also many other advanced features to it once a customer subscribes to the service.</p>
                                        <p>the task given to me was to give new look for the dashboard of the platform as the current is too complicated and isn't exactly user-friendly when it comes down the usability.</p>
                                        <p>within this task, i faced a few challenges such as understanding the type of design that is best suited for a platform like this, and also coming up with a design which was achieveable within the frameworks given.</p>
                                        <p>however, with the extensive amount of drafting and research, i eventually understood how to take these few things mentioned into consideration while designing the dashboard. Moreover, i also learned how to properly utilized the components feature to make the designing process more
                                            neat, efficient, and consistent.

								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/all_components.png" alt=""></span>
                                <p>Started off designing the multiple components needed for both web and mobile interfaces. These designs included icons, graphs, cards, tabs, and navs which also included the different variations such as active, disabled, unavailable, and many more.</p>
                                <span class="image featured"><img src="images/dashboard_design.png" alt=""></span>
                                <p>Dashboard with skeleton loader to show loading effect instead of blank page to users(left). Dasboard loaded all content(right).</p>
                                <span class="image featured"><img src="images/graphs.png" alt=""></span>
                                <p>Graphs were designed according to Chart.js as it is the plugin that was being used at the time being. </p>
                                <span class="image featured"><img src="images/toasts.png" alt=""></span>
                                <p>Toasts were designed to show an alert to users whenever an instance hasn't been complete or completed.</p>
                                <span class="image featured"><img src="images/dashboard report.png" alt=""><img src="images/monitoring dashboard.png" alt=""></span>
                                <p>Dashboards for other main features were also designed to extend the flow of the prototype.</p>
